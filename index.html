        <p class="lead">Hello, my name is Yunjong Noh! I'm an international student at California State University Long Beach. I am an older brother in my house and have 20 years old younger sister. As you can see in the picture below, I have a girlfriend who is kind, smart, humble, and pretty that I ever met before. I'm taking a Computer Science major!  As I mentioned above, I'm a foreigner who was born in South Korea. One interesting is that I was a soldier in South Korea. I served my country in January 2019 and was discharged from the service in August 2020. Therefore, if some of you guys are interested in the military, I can advise a little bit based on what I experienced. I'm friendly and like to talk with each other. I love to share my life story. As I rapping up this posting, I would like to say a beautiful comment.  it is, "Don't give up, and go for what you desire.</p>
